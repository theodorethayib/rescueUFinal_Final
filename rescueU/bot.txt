Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Turn Around, Don’t Drown!
Just six inches of moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep your vehicle away.
Stay off of bridges over fast-moving water.
Evacuate if told to do so.
Move to higher ground or a higher floor.
Stay where you are.
